ASSIGNMENT 1
QUESTION 1 
In 300 words, write a write-up on the differences and similarities between the 7-layer OSI reference model and the TCP/IP model
ANSWER
The OSI reference model and the TCP/IP model are two widely used networking models that help implement network protocols. 
SIMILARITIES
    1. Layered structure layers follow a layered structure that divides the network communication             processes into multiple layers. each layer performs a different function
    2. Data encapsulation in both, data encapsulation is used where data from higher layers is wrapped within the lower-level headers.
    3. Protocol stacks both models implement a protocol stack approach where each layer interacts with the corresponding layer.
    4. Widely used both models have been used widely in the networking industry.
    5. Conceptual framework in both models, a conceptual framework for understanding network protocols is used. They are also structured so that they analyze network communication, making it easy to troubleshoot.
DIFFERENCES
NO
OSI MODEL
TCP/IP MODEL  RESPECTIVELY
1
It has 7 layers. I.e. physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer.
It has 4 layers i.e., network interface layer, internet layer, transport layer, and application layer.
2
It is complex and allows greater flexibility
It is simple and more streamlined
3
It focuses on the separation of concerns and data encapsulation.
It focuses on end-to-end communication and routing.
4
Each layer has specific functions and responsibilities.
Layers are strictly defined and often combined into a single layer.
5
Can be used to understand various networks
Specially designed for the internet.
6
Theoretical model
Practical model
